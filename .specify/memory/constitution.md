# bcode-kaps Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. First Principles Approach
Break down problems into their fundamental truths and reason up from there. Avoid assumptions and analogies.

### II. Thorough Documentation
Every file, class, and function must have a docstring. The project as a whole must have a regularly updated README file. Descriptive comments should be used throughout the code to clarify complex logic.

### III. Testing
TDD is preferred. All code must be tested.

### IV. Verify > Assumptions
Always verify assumptions with data and evidence. Do not rely on unsubstantiated beliefs.

### V. AI Must Ask Clarifying Questions
The AI assistant must ask clarifying questions when given ambiguous instructions.

### VI. KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
Favor simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones.

### VII. Simple Explanations
Explain technical concepts in simple terms, avoiding jargon and long, verbose responses.
