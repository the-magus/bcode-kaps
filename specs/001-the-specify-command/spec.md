# Feature Specification: The /specify command

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-specify-command`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the /specify command"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Regarding the edge cases for the feature description, how should the system handle very long descriptions or descriptions with special characters? ‚Üí A: Allow any length and characters.
- Q: When an error is returned (e.g., no feature description), what should be the format of the error message? ‚Üí A: JSON object with an error code and message.
- Q: Are there any performance requirements for the `/specify` command? ‚Üí A: no
- Q: What level of logging is expected for the `/specify` command? ‚Üí A: Log errors only.
- Q: Should we explicitly define what is out of scope for this feature? ‚Üí A: n

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to create a feature specification from a natural language description, so that I can quickly start the development process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a natural language feature description, **When** I run the `/specify` command, **Then** a new feature branch is created and a `spec.md` file is generated with the feature specification.
2. **Given** no feature description, **When** I run the `/specify` command, **Then** an error is returned.

### Edge Cases
- The system MUST allow feature descriptions of any length and with any characters.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST create a new feature branch from a natural language description.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST generate a `spec.md` file in the new feature branch.
- **FR-003**: The `spec.md` file MUST be based on the `spec-template.md`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST return an error if no feature description is provided.
- **FR-005**: The branch name MUST be a slugified version of the feature description.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST output the new branch name and the path to the `spec.md` file.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST return errors as a JSON object with an error code and message.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: There are no specific performance requirements for the `/specify` command.
- **NFR-002**: The system MUST log errors only.
