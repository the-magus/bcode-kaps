# Feature Specification: Azure Barcode Generator

**Feature Branch**: `002-azure-barcode-generator`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Azure Barcode Generator"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What is the expected format of the email body from the WMS? ‚Üí A: HTML. The user provided a sample file.
- Q: The spec mentions handling malformed emails. What should happen in that case? ‚Üí A: Both ignore the email and log an error, and send a notification email to an administrator.
- Q: Where should the log of completed purchase orders be stored? ‚Üí A: Azure Blob Storage (as a text file)
- Q: How can we ensure that the emails are coming from the WMS and not from an unauthorized source? ‚Üí A: By checking the sender's email address.
- Q: What is the expected volume of purchase orders? ‚Üí A: 2-3 per day, 30 variants on average.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a warehouse manager, I want to automatically send barcode images to our supplier (Kaps) for new purchase orders, so that our warehouse staff doesn't have to manually label the signs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new purchase order report is emailed from the WMS, **When** the Azure Function App is triggered, **Then** it parses the variant details from the email body, generates barcode images, zips them, and emails the zip file to Kaps.
2. **Given** an email is received that is not a purchase order report, **When** the Azure Function App is triggered, **Then** it ignores the email and does not send anything to Kaps.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the email body is malformed?
- What happens if the email does not contain any variant details?
- What happens if the email sending to Kaps fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST run as an Azure Function App.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be triggered by an email from the WMS.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST parse variant details (variant code and description) from the HTML email body. The email body will contain a table with each item in a `<td>` element with the style `font-family:Arial; font-size:14px; color:gray; padding-top:10px;`. The text inside this `<td>` will have the format `PO: [PO_NUMBER] | Item: [ITEM_CODE] | Desc: [DESCRIPTION]`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate barcode images based on the variant details.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST create a zip file containing all the barcode images for a single purchase order.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST email the zip file to Kaps.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle emails that are not purchase order reports gracefully.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST log errors.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST extract the purchase order number from the email.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST use the purchase order number in the zip file name.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST use the purchase order number in the email subject.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST keep a log of completed purchase orders.
- **FR-013**: In case of a malformed email, the system MUST ignore the email, log an error, and send a notification email to an administrator.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST store the log of completed purchase orders in Azure Blob Storage as a text file.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST verify that the sender's email address is the expected WMS email address.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The system MUST be cost-efficient, running only when triggered.
- **NFR-002**: The system MUST be reliable and not depend on manual intervention.
- **NFR-003**: The system should be able to handle 2-3 purchase orders per day, with an average of 30 variants per purchase order.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Purchase Order**: Represents a purchase order from the WMS. Contains a purchase order number and a list of variants.
- **Variant**: Represents a single sign in a purchase order. Contains a variant code and a variant description.
- **Barcode**: Represents a barcode image generated for a variant.
